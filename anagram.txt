bool isAnagram(char* s, char* t) {
    int lenS = strlen(s);
    int lenT = strlen(t);
    if (lenS != lenT) return false;      // different lengths

    int count[26] = {0};                 // 'a' to 'z'

    for (int i = 0; i < lenS; i++) {
        count[s[i] - 'a']++;             // count chars in s
        count[t[i] - 'a']--;             // remove chars from t
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (count[i] != 0) return false; // mismatch in frequency
    }
    return true;
}

first we take length of S and T and then we make an array of 26 indices with 0 in all places
we check if length of both strings are equal if yes we continue else we return false
now, we start a for loop where we update count values by finding differnece between characters of S string and character 'a', this will give us index of that letter suppose its z so then it will be z-a which is 26-1
25 so we will increase the value at position 25 by 1, so 0 + 1 = 1
now in second count we do -- operation where we take characters from T string and do the same process, if S and T have the same characters then we will get our original array with 0s, but if not then there will be 
values pending in the array 
so this is what we are checking for in the last for loop, if count[i] is not equal to 0 then return false
else return true
