length of last word
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        i = len(s) - 1
        length = 0

        # Skip trailing spaces
        while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
            i -= 1

        # Count last word length
        while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ':
            length += 1
            i -= 1

        return length

basically, first we assign i at the end of the sentence, so if string is "end of moon" we assign i at n
now suppose the string is "end of moon " now since there is a space we need to move to the letter n as space is not allowed, so this is what the first while loop does, it discards the spaces 
now second while loop goes on counting the letters from last index till it finds another space
then it stops and returns length.
